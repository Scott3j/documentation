title: Screen recording & accessibility permissions when setting up CoScreen on macOs Catalina

If you are using macOS Catalina or above, you'll be asked to enable macOS screen recording permissions when joining your first CoScreen so you can share your windows with your peers. Apple wants users to express their consent that an application can capture the content of their application windows. 

In the context of CoScreen, this is used for screen sharing. CoScreen does not actually record or store any window content; instead, CoScreen shares the windows you have selected with your fellow team members who have access to the same CoScreen.
 
Granting this permission does not mean that CoScreen immediately captures your windows. This will only occur if you actively choose It will only do so once you actively choose to share your screen, while you are in a CoScreen.
 
CoScreen might also ask you to grant macOS accessibility permissions when joining your first CoScreen. These permissions enable you and your peers to move shared windows around, to resize them, and to type and click into them.
 
In both cases, a popup helps you configure the necessary settings and explains how to proceed.

**Note**: If you believe you have configured the right settings but you still cannot join any room, perform the following: remove the permissions  in macOS settings, restart CoScreen, and enable them again.
